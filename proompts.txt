Okay onto the next section i want to add. Today, the attention span of people is getting very low. A big portion of audiences don't bother reading a full blog article. I will add a "thuweets" section. its a play on tweets on twitter but its privately posted by only me. it will be a place where i can publicly express my own opinions and advice. make a thuweetsPage on which my thuweets are displayed by date order. I will for now store thuweets in json files in files by month (9-2025.json,10-2025.json,etc). later on, i will integrate my work in progress Content distribution system uris in place of the json to dynamically fetch and display the thuweets. make a thuweetCard keep the theme dark to align with the rest of the app.
