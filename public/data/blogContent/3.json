One day, while trying to edit a WooCommerce store page on my Chromebook, I found myself wrestling with plugin conflicts, theme inconsistencies, and an editor that just wouldn't fit on my screen. Like any reasonable developer, I decided to rebuild everything from scratch.\n\nWhat I discovered along the way became what I call HWSPA, Headless WordPress Single Page Application. It's not revolutionary, but it's incredibly practical for anyone tired of WordPress's frontend limitations.\n\n## The Problem with Traditional WordPress\n\nMost WordPress users aren't technical. The ecosystem reflects this: there's a plugin for everything, plugins for finding plugins, and endless dependencies. Every \"premium\" theme or plugin comes with multiple pricing tiers and a web of third-party requirements.\n\nThe frontend experience suffers from this complexity. Themes fight with plugins, page builders create bloated code, and performance takes a backseat to features. I realized I didn't need WordPress for the frontend\u2014I needed it for what it does best: content management.\n\n## The Solution: Decoupling WordPress\n\nHere's the simple idea: keep WordPress for content management and backend functionality, but build the frontend separately as a modern single-page application (SPA).\n\n### Technical Stack Overview:\n- **Backend**: WordPress with WooCommerce (no theme)\n- **Frontend**: Svelte SPA with Tailwind CSS\n- **Communication**: WordPress REST API (including WooCommerce Store API)\n- **Hosting**: Standard PHP server (Apache/Nginx)\n\n## How the Server is Structured\n\nHere's my directory structure that makes this work:\n\n```\n/public_html/                    # Web server root\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 index.html                   # SPA entry point\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 assets/                      # JS, CSS, images for SPA\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 js/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 css/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 images/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 wp/                          # WordPress installation\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 wp-admin/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 wp-content/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 wp-includes/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 wp-json/ \u2192 REST API endpoints\n```\n\n### Apache Configuration\n\nThe magic happens in the `.htaccess` file:\n\n```apache\n# Serve SPA for all routes except /wp/*\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/wp/\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\nRewriteRule ^ index.html [L,QSA]\n\n# WordPress rules (in /wp/.htaccess)\nRewriteBase /wp/\nRewriteRule ^index\\.php$ - [L]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\nRewriteRule . /wp/index.php [L]\n```\n\nThis setup ensures:\n- All requests to `/wp/*` go to WordPress\n- Everything else serves the SPA\n- The SPA handles routing client-side\n- Clean URLs without hash fragments\n\n## How the Frontend Works\n\nThe SPA is just static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. No PHP, no server-side rendering. It fetches all data from WordPress REST APIs:\n\n```javascript\n// Example: Fetching products\nconst response = await fetch('/wp/wp-json/wc/store/products');\nconst products = await response.json();\n```\n\n### Key WordPress APIs Used:\n- **Content**: `/wp-json/wp/v2/` (posts, pages, categories)\n- **WooCommerce**: `/wp-json/wc/store/` (products, cart, checkout)\n- **Custom endpoints**: For ACF fields and other custom data\n\nThe SPA communicates with WordPress using standard HTTP requests. For authenticated actions (like adding to cart), WooCommerce uses nonce-based authentication that's handled automatically through cookies.\n\n## Extending with Custom REST Endpoints\n\nHere's where it gets interesting. WordPress allows you to add custom REST API endpoints with minimal PHP code. I use this extensively with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF).\n\n### Example: Adding Teacher Profiles\n\nImagine you're building a university website. Instead of hardcoding teacher information, you can:\n\n1. **Create an ACF field group** for teachers (name, photo, bio, contact info)\n2. **Add a custom REST endpoint**:\n\n```php\n////In functions.php or a custom plugin\nadd_action('rest_api_init', function() {\n    register_rest_route('university/v1', '/teachers', [\n        'methods' => 'GET',\n        'callback' => 'get_teachers_data',\n        'permission_callback' => '__return_true'\n    ]);\n});\n\nfunction get_teachers_data() {\n//// Query teachers from ACF options or custom post type\n    $teachers = get_field('teachers', 'option');\n    return rest_ensure_response($teachers);\n}\n```\n\n3. **Fetch in the SPA**:\n\n```javascript\n// Frontend fetch\nconst response = await fetch('/wp/wp-json/university/v1/teachers');\nconst teachers = await response.json();\n\n// Display dynamically\nteachers.forEach(teacher => {\n    // Render teacher card\n});\n```\n\n### Benefits of This Approach:\n\n1. **Non-technical admins can update content** through WordPress dashboard\n2. **Real-time updates** without touching frontend code\n3. **Structured data** through ACF field groups\n4. **Reusable components** in the SPA\n\n## Real-World Implementation: My E-commerce Store\n\nFor my auto parts store, here's what I built:\n\n### Backend (WordPress):\n- WooCommerce for products, inventory, orders\n- ACF for homepage carousels, banners, featured sections\n- Standard WordPress for pages (About, Contact, etc.)\n- Various management plugins (analytics, SEO, etc.)\n\n### Frontend (Svelte SPA):\n- **Product listings** with search, filters, pagination\n- **Shopping cart** with real-time updates\n- **Checkout process** optimized for Pakistan (COD only)\n- **Responsive design** that works perfectly on mobile\n- **Fast loading** (no WordPress theme bloat)\n\n### Custom Endpoints I Created:\n- `/acf/v1/options/carouselslides` - Homepage hero carousel\n- `/acf/v1/options/salescarousel` - Promotional banners\n- Various other endpoints for dynamic content sections\n\n## Benefits I've Experienced\n\n### For Development:\n- **Clean separation** of concerns\n- **Modern frontend tools** (Svelte, Vite, Tailwind)\n- **Better performance** (static assets, optimized loading)\n- **Easier debugging** (browser devtools work perfectly)\n\n### For Content Management:\n- **Familiar WordPress dashboard** for admins\n- **Real-time content updates** without deployment\n- **Structured content** through ACF\n- **Plugin ecosystem** still available for backend\n\n### For Users:\n- **Fast page loads** (no WordPress theme overhead)\n- **Smooth interactions** (SPA navigation)\n- **Mobile-friendly** by design\n- **Clean, consistent UI**\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\nThis approach works well for:\n\n1. **E-commerce stores** (like mine)\n2. **University websites** (departments, faculty, courses)\n3. **Business directories** (listings with search/filters)\n4. **Event websites** (schedules, registrations)\n5. **Any content-heavy site** that needs a custom frontend\n\n## Challenges and Considerations\n\n### SEO\nSince it's an SPA, you need to handle:\n- Proper meta tags (I use `svelte:head`)\n- Server-side rendering for crawlers (optional, but recommended for large sites)\n- Sitemaps and structured data\n\n### Authentication\nWooCommerce uses cookie-based sessions. This works well but requires:\n- Proper CORS setup if hosting frontend separately\n- Secure handling of nonce tokens\n- Session management\n\n### Caching\n- WordPress REST API responses can be cached\n- Frontend assets can be aggressively cached (they're static)\n- You could consider a CDN for global distribution\n\nHWSPA isn't about reinventing the wheel\u2014it's about using the right tool for each job. WordPress excels at content management and has a massive plugin ecosystem. Modern JavaScript frameworks excel at building fast, interactive user interfaces.\n\nBy combining them, you get:\n- The content management power of WordPress\n- The user experience of a modern SPA\n- The performance of static assets\n- The flexibility to create exactly what you need\n\nIt's not for every project, but for content-heavy sites that need custom frontends, it's been a game-changer for me. The admin team gets their familiar WordPress dashboard, users get a fast and modern website, and I get to use the tools I enjoy.\n\nGive it a try on your next project, you might find it's exactly what you've been looking for.\n"
